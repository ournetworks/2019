Hello [ORG_CONTACT],

I'm a co-organizer for a community-driven event called State of Our
Networks, focusing on the past, present, and future of alternative
networks, including the decentralized and peer-to-peer web.

Now in our third year, our theme for 2019 is RE: Infrastructures, and
explores the collective care and maintenance of alternative networking
practicesâ€”new protocols, peer-to-peer connections, offline-first
computing, or community-based governance and ownership.

We have an ambitious schedule with afternoon workshops and a kickoff
party Friday, September 20 followed by a 2-day conference full of talks,
demos, and workshops September 21-22.

We are asking mission and value-driven sponsors to support us at our
"Tier 1 Network" level of $2500, in order to keep registration costs
low--critical for us as a community event, while still covering venue
fees, A/V and livestream costs, and more. In the attached sponsorship
package we've detailed how we would mark your support.

[Say something about fit between ORG and Our Networks]... speak directly
to the themes of the conference and I would love to speak with you about
sponsorship opportunities in the coming weeks, could we set up a call?

If this is a request that should be handled by someone else within
[ORG_NAME], I'd appreciate if you could put me in touch with the
correct person.


Many thanks,
