Title: Share your feedback--help us make Our Networks 2020 better!

Thank you again for attending Our Networks this past weekend, learning together, hanging out with us, and hopefully making new friends ðŸŒ±ðŸ’• 

Alongside fantastic presenters, a crew of wonderful volunteers, as well as great sponsors and partners, you made the event successful!


>> FEEDBACK

Help us improve Our Networks for 2020--we want to hear what you liked, what could be better, and any suggestions for next year. 

If you have 5 minutes for a short survey we'd appreciate hearing your feedback: https://ournetworks.ca/feedback/

Survey responses are anonymous and no questions are required (however we use formspree.io in order to send responses, so if you'd like you can email us directly: orga@ournetworks.ca).


>> RECORDED TALKS

Our A/V team's efforts continue and they are already hard at work post-processing videos from sessions. Once those are ready we'll send a final email for this year's event.

ðŸ•¸ We look forward to seeing you in 2020!
