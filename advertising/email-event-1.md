Hard to believe Our Networks is less than one week away! We just have some quick updates for you --


>> DIY SWAG: BRING YOUR OWN SHIRTS

In keeping with our themes of maintenance, remediation, and repair, we're shifting to mostly recycled swag this year--Bring Your Own Shirt and get it screenprinted onsite. Each day of the of the conference we'll have a station set up to print our amazing 2019 designs  on whatever you've brought that fits under the screen!
Not able to? Don't worry--we'll have a limited number of pre-printed shirts and totes.
