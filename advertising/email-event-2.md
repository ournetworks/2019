Hard to believe Our Networks is less than one week away! We just have some quick updates for you --

>> OUTDOOR SCREENING ON SATURDAY

Saturday night we'll cap off the day with an outdoor screening in Lisgar Park (weather permitting) of video essays and exporations of the infrastructures of our contemporary digital communications ðŸŒƒ. Starts just after sundown at 8:00 pm, if rain we'll keep it inside.


>> ZINE LIBRARY

We'll have set up the front area as a Zine Library where you can make, contribute, and "check out" copies of your favourite technology and infrastructure zines during the event. Have extra copies of a zine you love or one you made? Pack a few extra copies to share!


>> CHILDCARE

We will have a dedicated childminder onsite based on stated need over the weekend, further--children under 12 are free to attend! Please let us know by the end of Saturday registration if you require childcare assistance during the conference.
