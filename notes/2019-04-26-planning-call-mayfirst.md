            - Panel
            - Designed to be playful and fun

        - _Digital Justice Lab_, data justice, etc.
        - Data sovereignty, indigenous communities
        - Provincial governments gone very conservative (feeling the cuts!) -- labour focus on coalition approaches
        - Want more conversations around _mass surveillance_, _tech intermediation_, _social impact focused tech_
    - US left gravitational pull, but thinking about an exchange
- How is the conference set up?
    - Last year: everyone talk + split workshops
    - This year: still open-ended, want more time between sessions
    - Some people did presentation panel + workshop discussion
    - See 2018 proposals here: https://github.com/ournetworks/2018-submissions/issues
    - Honariaria of balance at end of conference for speakers, but without a lot of financial support (currently sorting sponsorships)
- Goals for Mayfirst:
    - Get a feel for what Canadian activists think and how they react
    - International and internatinalist org, want to be sensitive to other movements
    - Dream: conciousness to importance of collaboration
    - Still missing perspectives and want to ensure those are included
