Hi folks!

A little belated, I'm emailing about details for volunteering at Our Networks this weekend. Once again, thank you so much for contributing your time :)

We have a few task areas: Registration (also keeping an eye on the zine library beside), food setup, A/V, and breakdown or cleanup.

All of these activities will be in the Main Room (or Mezzanine) of TMAC, and we anticipate you will be able to listen to a portion if not the majority of the sessions happening in the room.

Only three other things to note:

>> SCHEDULE

Based on everyone's stated interests and availability I've made a preliminary schedule for the tasks we've identified during the event.

Please take a look and ensure there are no conflicts:

We want to accommodate sessions you'd like to attend so keep in mind you can request us to switch. We will finalize the schedule Friday during the afternoon.


>> ORIENTATION FRI 13.00

The "official" orientation will happen at 13.00 on Friday. This will just have information on tasks, our Code of Conduct, reporting guidelines, accessibility, and people you can ask for help.

I understand that many of you might not be able to attend, that is fine!

Please stop by the registration desk on Friday, Sept 20 anytime between 13.00 and 17.00 and chat to me (Dawn)-- I'm the main point of contact for volunteering questions! If Friday before 17.00 doesn't work, please let me know. We'll do remaining orientations on Saturday morning.


>> DIY SWAG: BRING YOUR OWN SHIRTS

Volunteers receive a free our networks shirt of their choice, as you may seen, this year we're shifting to mostly recycled swag this year.

We will have some pre-printed shirts as well as thrift store blank shirts for printing, but we'd encourage you to bring your own, perfectly-sized, shirt and have it printed onsite!
