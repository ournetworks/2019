Our Networks 2019 explores the collective care and maintenance of alternative networking practices&mdash;new protocols, peer-to-peer connections, offline-first computing, or community-based governance and ownership. Building on last year, where we asked how to move beyond solitary practices of do it yourself (DIY), in 2019 we explore what critical and creative practices offer **RE: Infrastructures** of alternatives.

How can these emerging **Infrastructures of <span id="word"></span>** provide spaces to imagine<span class="word-spacer"></span>
radically different futures, resist easy co-option by the forces of late-stage capitalism, and work in solidarity as plural networks seeking emancipatory change? To answer this we draw on insights from organizers, technologists, artists, and scholars to ensure the focus is not only on the technical aspects of infrastructure, but also the social and cultural. Their diverse perspectives suggest ways we can make space for livelihoods, solidarity, and survival; draw on history and place to bring our fullest imaginations to this moment; and open ways to think these questions together as we build transitional forms.

We are inviting proposals for talks, workshops, discussions, demonstrations, art pieces, and interventions to explore this theme. Topics could include, but are in no way limited to:

- Practices of reparative networking
- Remediation practices for communication infrastructures
- Uncooptable computing reconfigurations
- Reconstructing technology after refusal
- Regenerative approaches that resist status quo tech

### Format

This year will have a mix of scheduled and open space, as well as room for screenings, a zine library, and an art exhibition. We are inviting proposals to give a talk, lead a discussion, facilitate a workshop, or exhibit artwork that responds to the theme of _RE: Infrastructures_—we also encourage experimental proposals that don’t fit cleanly into these categories or may use the space in unexpected, or durational ways.

### Submission Deadlines

The deadline for proposals is **July 1, 2019**.

Submissions should follow our [template](https://github.com/ournetworks/2019-submissions/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/submission.md) and be [**submitted as a GitHub issue**](https://github.com/ournetworks/2019-submissions/issues/new) in our submissions repository. There will be additional opportunities closer to the event to sign up for short talks and to help shape activities, we encourage you to sign up for updates in order to keep in the loop.

### Who Can Submit?

Anyone interested in how we can build better online futures!

Our Networks is excited for sessions that centre the voices of those less often heard at technical events. We encourage BIPOC and LGBTQ2S folks to lead sessions and acknowledge the multiple marginalizations those with intersecting identities face. For 2019 we are also seeking to support people in their preferred language. If you are interested in leading a session in a language other than English please indicate so in your submission.

We want to provide a welcoming space for those speaking for the first time and the co-organizers are happy to help workshop a proposal during an open hour or by email.

### Not Sure? Ask Us!

We have four open hours for people to ask questions and workshop potential proposals and discuss the conference. No prior registration needed, just visit: [https://meet.jit.si/ournetworks](https://meet.jit.si/ournetworks).

If you have any additional questions let us know at [orga@ournetworks.ca](mailto:orga@ournetworks.ca)!
