Title: Presenting at Our Networks 2019 -- next week!

Hi all, we're down to the final week and last tickets left. If you know people thinking of going now is the time for them to register! Also we've got a slate of public events planned and attached a poster that can be circulated in your (Toronto) networks.

This email has info on session support, venue and accessibility, dietary requirements, our code of conduct, and honoraria. Let us know if there are any issues and how we can help: orga@ournetworks.ca


>> SESSION MATERIALS AND SUPPORT

The main room will have microphones, a speaker podium, and a table set up at the front. A laptop with presentation software will be set up in the main room but presenters are welcome to use their own device. 

Chart paper, markers, post-its and tape will be available for sessions that requested supplies at registration.

Sessions are indicated as back to back on our program. However while we will start sessions on the hour or stated time (e.g., 11 am or 2:30 pm), we will leave roughly 10 minutes at the end for switching over. Please plan your sessions accordingly!

Finally, please double check your session timing (https://ournetworks.ca/program/) and let us know if there are any issues ASAP.

>> ACCESSIBILITY

We are committed to reducing barriers to access throughout the event. All spaces have elevator access and accessible washrooms. The Outdoor screen takes place in the park in front of TMAC and is accessible from all sides via a gently sloping ramp, but is mostly level with the sidewalk. If you have any access considerations we should know about please reach out to us: orga@ournetworks.ca

As a presenter we ask you to consider the following suggestions to enhance the accessibility of any slides: using high-contrast slides with large fonts, using short-form links for any URLS, and providing a digital or hard copy for people to follow along. If you would like to provide hard copies of materials the organizers can assist with printing. Some guides with more information: https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/ and https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/


>> DIETARY REQUIREMENTS

Coffee and snacks will be provided mornings and during breaks. We'll also have lunch on both Saturday and Sunday. 
Vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and nut-free options will be available. 

Please let us know about any allergies or additional considerations ASAP: orga@ournetworks.ca


>> CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Networks has a Code of Conduct in order to foster an environment where we can all work together. We ask everyone to take a moment to review it beforehand: https://ournetworks.ca/code-of-conduct/

During the event if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, we ask you to contact an organizer immediately. Those who wish to do so but donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to the organizers in-person can email coc@ournetworks.ca, which will be monitored during the event.


>> HONORARIA

We aim to distribute honoraria the week after the event.
