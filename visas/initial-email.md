We are happy to write a letter supporting your visa application to travel to Toronto for Our Networks.

To write it, we need your:

- Date of birth
- Contact information (telephone number and email)
- Exact address
- The purpose of the visit to Canada (if you're doing anything besides attend Our Networks)
- The duration of the visit
- Where you will stay in Canada and how you will pay for the stay (probably the name of your employer and job title)
- The date when you will arrive in Canada and the date you will leave (approximately is probably fine, since we know the conference dates)

Please feel free to use encrypted channels. I can do either:

1. GPG: [OUR_NETWORKS_CONTACT_KEY_DETAILS]
2. Matrix via encrypted chat: [OUR_NETWORKS_MATRIX_HANDLE]
3. Signal [OUR_NETWORKS_CONTACT_NUMBER]

Regards,

[OUR_NETWORKS_CONTACT]
