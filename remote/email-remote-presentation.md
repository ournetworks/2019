Dear presenters of Our Networks 2019! Please review the following procedures for your remote presentation and/or Q&A session :)

> BEFORE YOUR REMOTE SESSION

1. Please confirm that the scheduled time works for you https://ournetworks.ca/program/ and send us the local time and timezone that you will call in, and indicate how many presenters will be on the call

2. Please send us a link to download your recorded presentation before Tuesday, September 17. You can upload it to https://wetransfer.com then send us the download link.

3. Please join the Matrix room #ournetworks:tomesh.net ahead of your remote session. This is the public chat to coordinate throughout Our Networks 2019. If you do not have a Matrix account, you can register one here https://matrix.org/try-now

4. Download the Zoom desktop application for your remote session https://zoom.us/download (you do not need to create an account to call in but you must use the application)

5. Send us your Google account in case Zoom fails, then we will use Google Hangouts for the remote session as fallback

> DAY OF YOUR REMOTE SESSION

1. Say hi on #ournetworks:tomesh.net at least 15 minutes before your session, as listed https://ournetworks.ca/program/ (hours are listed in EST)

2. Using the Zoom desktop application, join the meeting at least 15 minutes before your session:

> Meeting ID [ZOOM_MEETING_ID] 
> Password   [ZOOM_MEETING_PASSWORD]

or use the link [ZOOM_MEETING_LINK] (the password is included in the link, do not share publicly)

3. During Q&A, you will hear audience questions and the moderator from the Zoom meeting audio feed. The moderator may also triage questions from #ournetworks:tomesh.net and our Twitter hashtag and read them out as questions. All questions will be transcribed into the Zoom meeting chat for clarity

> AFTER YOUR REMOTE SESSION

1. If you have previously indicated that the presentation can be recorded and posted on the Our Networks website under a Creative Commons License, we will proceed to post-process the recording and publish it with the 2019 archive.
